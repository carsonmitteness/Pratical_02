Example - Index and query JSON documentsLearn how to use the Redis query engine with JSONThis example shows how to create a
search index
for JSON data and
run queries against the index.Make sure that you have Redis Stack and redis-py installed.Import dependencies:Connect to your Redis database.Create some test data to add to your database.Create an index. In this example, only JSON documents with the key prefix user: are indexed. For more information, see Query syntax.Add the three sets of user data to the database as
JSON objects.
If you use keys with the user: prefix then Redis will index the
objects automatically as you add them:You can now use the index to search the JSON objects. The
query

and have an age value in the range 30 to 40:Specify query options to return only the city field:Use an
aggregation query

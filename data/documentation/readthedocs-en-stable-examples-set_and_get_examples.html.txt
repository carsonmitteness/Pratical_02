Basic set and get operations# Start off by connecting to the redis server# To understand what decode_responses=True does, refer back to this document The most basic usage of set and get We can override the existing value by calling set method for the same key It is also possible to pass an expiration value to the key by using setex method A dictionary can be inserted like this To get multiple keys’ values, we can use mget.

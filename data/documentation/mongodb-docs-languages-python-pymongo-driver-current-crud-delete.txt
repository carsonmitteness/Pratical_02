Delete Documents Overview In this guide, you can learn how to use PyMongo to remove
documents from a MongoDB collection by performing delete operations. A delete operation removes one or more documents from a MongoDB collection.
You can perform a delete operation by using the delete_one() or
delete_many() methods. Sample Data The examples in this guide use the sample_restaurants.restaurants collection
from the Atlas sample datasets. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
Get Started with PyMongo tutorial. Delete Operations You can perform delete operations in MongoDB by using the following methods: Each delete method requires a query filter document, which specifies the
search criteria that determine which documents to select for removal.
For more information about query filters, see the
Query Filter Documents section in
the MongoDB Server manual. Delete One Document The following example uses the delete_one() method to remove a document in
the restaurants collection with a name value of "Ready Penny Inn": query_filter = { "name": "Ready Penny Inn" }  result = restaurants.delete_one(query_filter) Delete Multiple Documents The following example uses the delete_many() method to remove all documents
in the restaurants collection with a borough value of "Brooklyn": query_filter = { "borough": "Brooklyn" }  result = restaurants.delete_many(query_filter) Customize the Delete Operation The delete_one() and delete_many() methods optionally accept additional
parameters, which represent options you can use to configure the delete
operation. If you don't specify any additional options, the driver does not customize
the delete operation. The following code uses the delete_many() method to delete all documents in
the restaurants collection with a name value that includes the string "Mongo".
It also uses the comment option to add a comment to the operation: query_filter = { 'name': {'$regex': 'Mongo' }}  result = restaurants.delete_many(query_filter, comment="Deleting Mongo restaurants") Tip If the preceding example used the delete_one() method instead of
delete_many(), the driver would delete only the first document with a
name value that includes "Mongo". Return Value The delete_one() and delete_many() methods return a
DeleteResult type. This type contains the following properties: Note If the acknowledged attribute is False, all other attributes of DeleteResult
raise an InvalidOperation exception when accessed. The driver cannot
determine these values if the server does not acknowledge the write operation. If the query filter does not match any documents, the driver doesn't delete any
documents and deleted_count is 0. API Documentation To learn more about any of the methods or types discussed in this
